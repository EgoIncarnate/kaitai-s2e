# "Targeting" File Parsers with S2E and Kaitai Struct

This code accompanies my blog post ["Targeting" File Parsers with S2E and
Kaitai Struct](https://adrianherrera.github.io/post/kaitai-s2e).

The contents of each directory should be copied into the directory of the same
name in your S2E environment, located at `$S2EDIR`.

* guest: `$S2EDIR/source/s2e/guest`
* libs2eplugins: `$S2EDIR/source/s2e/libs2eplugins`
* readelf_kaitai: `$S2EDIR/projects/readelf_kaitai`
